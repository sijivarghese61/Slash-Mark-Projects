# Slash-Mark-Projects
Welcome to the Slash Mark Internship Projects repository! This repository contains the various projects and tasks completed during my internship at Slash Mark as a Java Intern. The projects demonstrate my proficiency in Java programming and my ability to apply my skills to real-world problems.

## Overview
During the internship, I worked on a range of tasks that involved developing applications, implementing features, and solving complex problems. Each project highlights different aspects of Java programming, including object-oriented design, GUI development, and secure coding practices.

## BASIC Project:

### Task 1 : Simple Task List Application

* Description: I developed a basic Java application that allows users to manage a task list. The program features a simple text-based interface where users can add, remove, update, and list tasks efficiently. It demonstrates fundamental concepts in Java, including the use of ArrayLists and handling user input through a console interface. This project emphasizes practical task management and helps users stay organized in a minimalistic console environment.

* Key Features:
  * Add new tasks to the list
  * Remove tasks from the list
  * Display the list of tasks
  * Update existing tasks
  * Handle empty task list scenarios.

### Task 2 : Password Generator using Java

* Description: In today's world of increasing cyber threats, it's more important than ever to use strong, unique passwords for different accounts. That's why I developed a GUI Password Generator application. The application provides options for customizing password length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). It also includes functionality for displaying the generated password. To further enhance security, I implemented encryption, ensuring that generated passwords are stored in an encrypted format, adding an extra layer of protection.

* Key Features:
  * Customizable password length
  * Toggle options for including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols
  * Generate and display passwords
  * Encode and display the encoded password in console.

### Task 3 Snake Game using Java

* Description: Remember those classic snake games we all enjoyed as kids? I decided to take that nostalgic fun and enhance it using Java. While the concept of the game might seem simple, implementing it with Java concepts proved to be quite a challenge. From handling game logic to managing graphics and user input, this project required a deep dive into Java programming to bring the game to life. The game features basic gameplay mechanics, including snake movement, apple consumption, and score tracking. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and game development fundamentals.

* Key Features:
  * Snake movement controlled by keyboard inputs
  * Apple spawning and consumption mechanics
  * Score tracking and display
  * Game-over conditions when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.
